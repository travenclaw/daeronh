        <p>Dear Jace,<br><br></p>
        <p>Three months have passed and I wish I could say it’s been perfect. But the truth is, lately we’ve been slipping into silence. Not the peaceful kind, but the kind that comes when hearts are too tired to keep hurting. There’s something that’s been weighing heavily on my heart. The words your sister said, that you deserve to be loved by someone who isn’t me. I know, I shouldn’t let it live in my head. I shouldn’t give it power. But it hurt more than I expected. It made me question whether I’ve ever been enough for you, whether I’ve only been a shadow of what you truly need.<br><br></p>
        <p>I’m sorry I let those words affect me. But I can’t deny that they cut deep. And yet, despite the doubt, despite the pain—I still love you. I love you when we laugh, and I love you when we barely speak. I love you even when everything feels wrong between us. I love you when it’s easy, and I love you even more when it’s hard. Yes, things are messy. Yes, we’ve said things that hurt. Yes, we’ve drifted into a space where love feels like walking on thin ice. But even then, my heart keeps choosing you. Again and again.<br></p>
        <p>I may not be perfect. I may not always know the right words. But my love for you has always been real. And it still is. I don’t know if we’ll make it through. But if there’s still a path forward, I want to walk it with you, hand in hand, honestly, even if it means rebuilding slowly. So here’s my truth, I love you. Still. Deeply. Completely.<br><br></p>
        <p>Even when it hurts. Even when I’m unsure. Even when the world makes me doubt myself, I will never doubt how much I love you.<br><br></p>
        <p>Thank you for all the laughter that made me feel alive, for the warmth of your love that held me even when my world was falling apart, and for the moments where your presence made everything feel right. You gave me memories I’ll never forget, smiles that came so naturally, and a love that, despite everything, still makes my heart ache in the most beautiful way. I’m sorry if lately I’ve been distant, if I’ve let my fears speak louder than my love, if I’ve unknowingly pushed you away when all I truly wanted was to pull you closer. It was never because I didn’t love you. It’s just sometimes, I get so scared of losing you, I end up breaking things that mean the most to me. Please know, my distance was never rejection, it was pain, confusion, and a heart that’s still learning how to heal without hurting the one it loves most.</p>
