          <div class="card">
            <div class="card-number">1. I hope that you remain healthy, always.</div>
            <p>I want nothing more than for you to be strong, both physically and mentally. Health is the foundation of everything, and without it, it's hard to enjoy life to its fullest. I hope you live a life that is free from illness, where your body and mind are in harmony, allowing you to chase your dreams and live a long, fulfilling life. May you wake up every day feeling energized, ready to face whatever the world throws your way.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="card">
            <div class="card-number">2. I hope you find happiness, in all its forms.</div>
            <p>Happiness is more than just a fleeting moment; it's a way of living, a state of being. I hope you find joy in the little things, in every corner of your life. Whether it's a simple cup of coffee, a walk in nature, or a conversation with a loved one, I hope happiness fills your days. I want you to experience laughter that comes from deep within, moments of peace that make you feel content, and love that makes you feel truly cherished.</p>

          <div class="card">
            <div class="card-number">3. I hope that you always have the strength to face whatever life throws at you.</div>
            <p>Life isn’t always kind, and there will be times when it feels like the weight of the world is on your shoulders. But I hope you have the inner strength to keep going. I hope you find courage when fear tries to hold you back, resilience when obstacles arise, and the determination to never give up. Even in moments of doubt, I hope you hold your head high, knowing that you are capable of overcoming anything life challenges you with.</p>

          <div class="card">
            <div class="card-number">4. I hope you will find someone who can love you better than I could.</div>
            <p>You deserve to be loved in the way that you need, in the way that fills every empty space inside you. I may have tried, but I know that there is someone out there who will be able to love you in ways I couldn’t. I hope this person treats you with the kindness, respect, and care you truly deserve, offering you a love that is unwavering and deeply fulfilling. You deserve a love that makes you feel whole and cherished every single day.</p>

            <p>I know how much effort you put into your studies, and I truly hope that all your hard work pays off. I want you to achieve your academic goals and more. May you continue to push yourself and never settle for anything less than your best. Whether it’s passing a difficult exam or excelling in a subject you love, I hope you receive the recognition you deserve. You have the potential to go so far, and I hope your education becomes the stepping stone to your future success.</p>

          <div class="card">
            <div class="card-number">6. I hope you continue to have patience, even in the hardest of times.</div>
            <p>Life isn’t always smooth sailing. There will be moments when things seem impossible and when it feels like everything is moving too slowly. I hope you are able to cultivate patience during these times. Patience allows us to remain calm in the face of adversity, to trust that things will unfold in their own time. I hope you find peace in knowing that you don’t need to rush, and that everything will happen when the time is right.</p>
          </div>

            <p>Personal growth is a lifelong journey, and I hope you continue to evolve into the person you aspire to be. Every day offers an opportunity to learn, grow, and improve. I hope you take those opportunities, pushing yourself to be kinder, wiser, more compassionate, and more self-aware. The process of becoming better may not always be easy, but I know that every step you take will bring you closer to the best version of yourself.</p>

            <p>Heartbreak is one of the most painful experiences we go through, and I wish with all my heart that you never have to experience it. I hope you are spared from the hurt that comes from betrayal, disappointment, and loss. I wish that your heart stays intact, and that any challenges you face are ones that make you stronger, not ones that break you. May your heart always remain open and free from the scars that pain can leave behind.</p>

            <div class="card-number">11. I hope you never feel alone, even when I am no longer by your side.</div>
            <p>While life may take us in different directions, I hope you never feel alone. I wish for you to always have people by your side who love and support you. Even if our paths part, I want you to know that there are countless people who will be there for you when you need them.

          <div class="card">
            <div class="card-number">13. I hope you can laugh again, without remembering me with pain.</div>
            <p>Laughter is healing, and I hope that in time, you’ll be able to look back on the memories we shared without any of the sadness that might now accompany them. I wish for you to laugh freely, without any sense of bitterness or regret. I want you to feel the joy of life again, as you did before, and to embrace the happiness that surrounds you without the weight of past heartaches.</p>

            <div class="card-number">14. I hope you learn to love yourself first, before anyone else.</div>
            <p>Self-love is the foundation of all other love, and I hope you learn to prioritize your own well-being above all else. I wish for you to nurture your own soul, to appreciate your worth, and to give yourself the care and compassion you so easily give to others. When you love yourself fully, you attract the love that you truly deserve, and you are able to share it with others in the most meaningful way.</p>

            <p>Home is not just a physical place; it’s where you feel at peace, safe, and loved. I hope you find that place—whether it’s a physical location or simply a feeling of belonging. May you always have a sense of home wherever you go, even if I’m no longer part of your life. I want you to feel comfortable and grounded, with people and experiences that make you feel truly at ease.</p>

            <p>Life is filled with choices, and I hope you gain the wisdom to know when to hold on and when to let go. It’s not always easy to walk away from something that once mattered, but I hope you develop the strength to let go of what no longer serves you. May you always fight for what truly matters—your happiness, your peace, and your well-being—and let go of the things that weigh you down.</p>
          </div>
